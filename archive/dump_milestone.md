### Criteria for Firmware Dump milestone

These are my criteria; others may have different criteria. If the goal is claimed to be met and also meets my criteria, I, @nelsonjchen, will try to convince the other bounty offers for the firmware dump milestone to align their criteria with mine and fulfill their pledge.

1. Enough instructions to be reproduced by someone else
2. Video/Pictures of loading the dump into a disassembler and showing that it loads and showing some strings in the dump that are obviously from a relevant Toyota ECU Security'd ECU and coherently disassembled machine instructions.
3. The firmware must be from a Toyota ECU that has ECU Security Key.

A good example of "Enough instructions" and "Videos/Pictures" would be these blog posts regarding hacking/dumping a VW Golf Power Steering ECU: https://blog.willemmelching.nl/carhacking/2022/01/02/vw-part1/

Reverse engineering the security system is not needed. Please don't openly share the copyrighted firmware. The amount of sharing with the second criteria should be just enough with fair use to show that the firmware dump has been accomplished and that it can be reproduced.

Also, if the system is cracked without the firmware dump, consider this firmware dump milestone met too.
