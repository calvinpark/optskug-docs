You've got a message you want to send to Bob. In the old cars, Bob didn't know who was sending him letters to his inbox, so he would blindly read anything you sent him.  Now Bob is getting suspicious of people that aren't his co-workers to be sending him messages. He gives all his coworkers a red stamp with a roll of numbers on it. Every time a coworker sends a message, they change the stamp to a new code position, then stamp the envelope with the code. Bob knows what the next code should be. We are trying to send Bob messages without the special stamp, so Bob knows to ignore our letters.
If we go through bobs inbox, we know he's getting the same letters. He also knows we're sending the same letters, but as long as that envelope isn't stamped, you can't get anywhere.

nelson note: this isn't the best analogy, but it gets across the point that the message is readable, but we can't notarize it.
